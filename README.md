# SO-ARM Scratch Programming Interface

A kid-friendly visual programming interface for the SO-ARM101 robot arm using block-based programming similar to Scratch.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **3D Robot Visualization**: See your robot in a 3D environment
- ðŸ§© **Block-Based Programming**: Drag and drop blocks to program your robot
- ðŸ”— **Direct Robot Connection**: Connect to your physical SO-ARM101 via USB/Serial
- ðŸ‘¶ **Kid-Friendly Interface**: Designed specifically for children to learn programming
- ðŸ’¾ **Save/Load Programs**: Export and import your programs as JSON files
- âš¡ **Real-time Control**: See your program execute on both the virtual and physical robot

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
